Try The Code on Your Conputer
------

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to have Node and npm set up
1. Clone the latest code `git clone https://github.com/krosenk729/Lets-Build-Things.git`
1. Navigate to the project root using `cd Lets-Build-Things`
1. Delete the `.git` directory so you start fresh if you choose to later commit the repo
1. Type `npm install` to install the latest code dependencies 
1. Run `node build.js`
